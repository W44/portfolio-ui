        As a developer, I have designed and implemented RESTful APIs using Python and the Flask framework, 
        ensuring seamless communication between services. I worked as a full-stack developer on a microservices 
        architecture-based application, utilizing Angular 15 for the frontend and .NET for the backend. My role 
        included optimizing performance by refining database schemas, improving code, and integrating Elasticsearch.
